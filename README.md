# Customer Analysis using SQL  
## Data Analysis Project – Part 3

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer data using **SQL** to uncover meaningful insights related to customer behavior, segmentation, and trends.  
It is the **third project** in my data analysis learning journey, following:
- Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Part 2: Advanced Excel Analysis

---

## 🎯 Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To explore customer data using SQL queries
- To identify patterns and trends in customer behavior
- To perform customer segmentation using aggregations
- To strengthen SQL querying and analytical thinking skills

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- SQL
- Relational Database Concepts
